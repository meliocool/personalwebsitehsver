       Apex Legends is a Free To Play Battle Royale game by EA and can be downloaded from Origin, I love this game because of the graphics and 
       i can play it with 2 of my friends and it's a pretty popular FPS Battle Royale game. It's a pretty demanding game because it's best to be played on a medium to high end PC. But overall, its pretty fun 
       for a free game.

      Valorant is a Free to Play Shooter game made by Riot Games, the same developer who made League of Legends. I love this game because it runs smooth on my PC, 
      and i can play it with 4 or even more people. It's similar to Counter Strike, but i prefer Valorant now because it's more fun and immersive. It's not a 
      demanding game because you can play it on a low end PC. Overall a fun FPS experience.

      Dota 2 is a Free to Play MOBA game available on PC by Valve. It is by far my favorite game of all time, because it's what introduced me to Video Games on PC. 
      I've spent nearly 5,500 hours on it. It can be downloaded through Steam. It's a fun yet complex MOBA game to play. Some people prefer playing Mobile MOBA games 
      like Mobile Legends or League of Legends: Wild Rift. But for me Dota is so much fun if you can play it well. Overall my personal favorite game of all time.

        This is my school, <strong><i>SMA Perguruan Cikini</i></strong>. It's definitely not the best private school in Jakarta, but i guess 
        you can't really ask much. But i'm grateful that i could go to school and be educated. It has some cool facility such as a Laboratium for science stuff
        Air Conditioner, a good library, a cafetaria with some good food, a mosque, a basketball and soccer field, and a free wifi. for more information, you can tap 
        on the Picture! you will be directed to the Official Perguruan Cikini Website

   Since the pandemic starts, i have been studying at home. i'm gonna be honest though, Online school sucks, i prefer offline school. Especially because some people would say that Highschool is the golden year. You could get a girlfriend, experience the school facility, and hangout with friends at school. But i'm okay with Online school because theres less subjects a day and school ends at 12. Speaking of school subjects, here are my School Schedule!
